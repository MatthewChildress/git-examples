This is the exampleOneA branch.

Git allows you to create branches from branches.

Be mindful of where in the git tree you're branching from though for merging back into main.

A good use case for this would be two or more people working in the same dev branch to fix a section of code.

having a branch of a branch is also good if you're wanting to try something different in your code since it gives you an extra layer away from the main branch.
