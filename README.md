This is the exampleOneFour branch.


When pushing code to the remote repo, there are three main stages.

"add" stages all the changes you've made. You can add specific files or add everything with "*"

Ex - git add *


"status" gives you a list of files added to be commited

Ex - git status

"commit" creates a new commit state. you need the flag -m to write your message

Ex - git commit -m "This is a git message"


"push" takes the files you've add to your commit and pushes them to the remote repo.
